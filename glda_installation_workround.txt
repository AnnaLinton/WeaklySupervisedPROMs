This is a read me on how to get guided_lda working when the package will not successfully build wheels.

This is in no way meant to undermine the author of the guided_lda package or to replace it in anyway and is 
simply meant as a work around until the issue can be fully resolved.

1. Pull down the repository.

2. Install the original LDA package. 
	https://pypi.org/project/lda/
	
3. Drop the *.py files from the GuidedLDA_WorkAround repo in the lda folder under site-packages for your specific enviroment.
